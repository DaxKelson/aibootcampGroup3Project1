https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/raedaddala/imdb-movies-from-1960-to-2023

## Project Description:
We are using this data scraped from the IMBD website. Our goal is to iddentify which movies performed the best in the box office given a low budget. We hope to identify a base threshold of budget for creating a movie that will lead to the best probability of making the money back in the box office.

### Additional Questions
1. Are there directors that direct movies that have higher revenues
2. Group by rating column "mpa" and sort by difference between budget and grossing worldwide vs US to see if movies make more money dependent on their rating
3.

## Credits
Group everything by year
add column with percentage of movie budget vs budget for movies that year
add column with percentage of movie grossing worldwide vs grossing worldwide for movies that year
add column that does a ratio for percent budget and percent grossing. budget % / grossing %. sort lowest to greatest to get movies that did the best with lower budgets.

Take buckets to see what percentage of movies did well with different buckets of budget amounts
Figure out what minimum budget you need to get a movie with the best chances of success
