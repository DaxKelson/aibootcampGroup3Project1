We hope to identify a base threshold of budget for creating a movie that will lead to the best probability of making the money back in the box office.

## Summary of Analysis

## Credits
1. Dax Kelson               |   Profitability By Genre & Popularity of Genre by Year

## Additional Questions
1. Are there directors that direct movies that have higher revenues
2. Are Movies more or less profitable when taking ratings into account ie. are pg-13 movies more profitable than rated R movies? Group by rating column "mpa" and sort by difference between budget and grossing worldwide vs US to see if movies make more money dependent on their rating
3. Popularity of Genre by year
4. IMDB Rating vs Budget. Did lower budget movies do better with IMBD rating?
5. Take buckets to see what percentage of movies did well with different buckets of budget amounts
Figure out what minimum budget you need to get a movie with the best chances of success
Group everything by year
add column with percentage of movie budget vs budget for movies that year
add column with percentage of movie grossing worldwide vs grossing worldwide for movies that year
add column that does a ratio for percent budget and percent grossing. budget % / grossing %. sort lowest to greatest to get movies that did the best with lower budgets.
